The aim of the prework is to surface automation opportunities, pain points, and wishlists from staff—especially those closest to workflows and member experience. Questions should be broad enough to invite creativity but specific enough to anchor responses in the day-to-day. Suggested categories and prompts:
Theme 1: Workflow Friction
“What’s a repetitive task you wish you didn’t have to do?”
“Where do you feel your time is being wasted?”
“What’s one thing you often have to chase people or systems for?”
Theme 2: Member Experience
“Where do members get stuck, confused, or frustrated?”
“What could make our service faster or more personalised?”
Theme 3: Decision Support / Insight Gaps
“What decisions are hard to make due to lack of data or clarity?”
“If you could get one new insight instantly, what would it be?”
Theme 4: Wishlist / Future Vision
“If you had a smart assistant that understood your role, what would you want it to do for you?”
“If you could change one system or process overnight, what would it be?”
:test_tube: 2. What do we expect to do with the responses?
The agent will cluster and theme responses, using AI + human sensemaking to:
Detect recurring patterns across roles or departments
Translate “local pain points” into strategic opportunities
Reframe language into CareSuper’s voice, aligned to:
AI strategy
Strategic pillars
Compliance guardrails
This gives the Day 1 session a head start—instead of starting with a blank whiteboard, you’re starting with “live signals” from the business, thematically organised and already aligned.
:repeat: 3. How do we process them?
We process responses using a hybrid approach:
Conversational AI agent collects free-text answers
Optionally tags each by role/function
LLM-powered clustering and summarisation
Themes detected via semantic similarity
Manual curation by EE team
Remove duplication, clarify intent
Reframe as opportunity statements (e.g. “Reduce manual rekeying in contribution processing”)
Mapped into strategic themes
Examples: “Member Service Uplift,” “BAU Automation,” “Data Activation,” “Operational Resilience”
:date: 4. What will we have, and how will we use it on the day?
By the time we walk into Day 1 of the Thinktank, we’ll have:
:white_tick: Prework Pack:
Themed pain points and ideas, reframed as problem/opportunity statements
Heatmap of responses by frequency and business area
Preliminary alignment map to CareSuper strategic goals and AI priorities
:spanner: Used in Day 1:
Kick-off with these as discussion starters
Used to guide journey mapping and divergent ideation
Helps teams go deeper, faster—less time “warming up,” more time validating and evolving ideas
